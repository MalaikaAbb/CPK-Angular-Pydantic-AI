/**
 * The popup half of the guide's "Use a popup or sidebar" sample, on its own
 * host. Bindings are the guide's, unchanged.
 *
 * The guide declares `copilot-popup` and `copilot-sidebar` in one component.
 * Both render a launcher at the same fixed coordinates
 * (`right: max(1.5rem, …); bottom: max(1.5rem, …)`), so mounting them together
 * stacks two launchers on one spot and the sidebar — rendered second — takes
 * every click. Splitting them is what makes each surface separately testable;
 * the combined component is kept verbatim in popup-sidebar.component.ts and
 * shown as the source on the route page.
